# MAAV Computer Vision Repository

This repository containc Python files that will implement and test our computer
vision algorithms that we intend to use on our vehicle for Mission 9 of IARC.

While our code base is written in C++ primarily, we are composing
our algorithms in Python because the OpenCV library is available for
both languages, and Python allows an easy way to test code and import the
OpenCV library while avoiding the hassles that come with including OpenCV
using CMake, ROS with catkin_ws, etc.

Additionally, this gives members of our team experience working with Python.

# Getting Started

This tutorial was intended for Ubuntu / Linux, and modified for support in Mac
and Windows WSL environments. While most issues have been worked out, you may
have some difficulties still - reach out if you have trouble.

First, clone this repository. You can either use HTTPS or SSH with a key setup
through your account.
```bash
$ git clone <link>
$ cd maav-cv
```

Next, install required software to create a Python virtual environment for
installing dependencies and working on CV projects.
```bash
# WSL / Linux:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.7 python3-pip
$ pip install virtualenv

# Mac with Homebrew:
$ brew install python@3.7
$ pip install virtualenv
```

Setup your virtual environment using Python 3.7.x.
```bash
# WSL / Linux:
$ virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.7 env
$ source env/bin/activate

# Mac:
$ virtualenv --python=/usr/local/Cellar/python@3.7/3.7.9/bin/python3.7
$ source env/bin/activate
```

**NOTE: You MUST source the activate file everytime you begin any testing or
development!! That lets your terminal know what package install directory to
use for the code.**

We have included `requirements.txt` to install OpenCV and any other required
Python libraries. To install these requirements,
run the following command:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Windows and WSL Aside: X-Server

Normally OpenCV GUI code can run just fine in this environment. However, if
you attempt to run this code in Windows with WSL, you will encounter an
error similar to one of these:
```bash
$ python3 hello.py

...
qt.qpa.xcb: could not connect to display
...

# OR

...
: cannot connect to X server
```

This is because Windows and WSL do not natively support Linux GUI applications.
We will install an external program to host an X-Server, which will process
data and display a GUI that interacts with your program.

The X-Server application we will use is vcXsrv, which you can
[download here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/). After installing,
start the application, and start it with default settings **EXCEPT FOR ONE:
Disable Access Control**

![vcXsrv App Image](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/201596iBCB2B8DA889830E0)

Then, you need to set an environment variable in your WSL terminal so that
the X-Server will be used for displaying GUI apps.

First, see what version of WSL you are using. Open Windows Powershell, and run
the following command:
```
> wsl -l -v
  NAME                   STATE           VERSION
* Ubuntu-18.04           Running         2
  ...
```
In this example, I am running WSL2. So, once you know which version you are
running, use the appropriate `DISPLAY` environment variable below:
```bash
# WSL1:
$ export DISPLAY="localhost:0"

# WSL2:
$ export DISPLAY="`grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | sed 's/nameserver //'`:0"
```
**Tip:** Add this line to the end of your `~/.bashrc` so that it will run
everytime you start a new bash terminal. It's an extra step you won't have
to remember.

# Running Sample Code

At this point, you should be able to run the sample code without difficulties:
```bash
$ python3 hello.py
```
Depending on some other factors involving `pyrealsense2`, you might also
be able to run the Depth Camera sample code if you have an Intel D4XX camera:
```bash
$ python3 hello-rs.py
```

I encourage you to look at the code and modify it. For example, change the
image used, modify the image using OpenCV functions, or do anything else
creative you can think of!

# Development Etiquette

This section is subject to change throughout the course of development.
At times, Google can be your friend with Git, but reach out to us with
any help you may need!

When in doubt, [check out "Oh Shit! Git!"](https://ohshitgit.com)

## Git Identity

Make sure your identity through Git is setup well.

```bash
# List current global config, which may contain identity info

$ git config --global -l
user.name=Jacob Minock
user.email=jaminock@umich.edu
core.editor=vim
...

# Set or Change some things (for any repository you use)
# Omit --global to just make it for THIS repository

$ git config --global user.name "Jacob Minock"
$ git config --global user.email "jaminock@umich.edu"
```

## Git Branches

When developing a specific, new feature or set of changes, we suggest making
a branch for new files or the modifications of existing files. This will
allow your `master` branch to stay clean and organized in terms of commit
history and other qualities. Generally changes to the `master` branch only
happen with very small fixes - like updating a `README.md` or one doc.

```bash
# List branches
$ git branch

# Create a new branch
$ git checkout -b <branch>

# Switch to a branch
$ git checkout <branch>
```

## Git Repository Fork

Simple GitHub Forking Tutorial:

https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/

Cloning repositories is a straightforward approach to making changes to shared repositories. 'Forked' repositories are personal copies of a shared project, in which you can make changes, and then offer those changes up to the original project.

# Appendix B: Install RealSense from Source for Python

You might run into the following, especially on a Mac, when running
`pip install -r requirements`:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
...
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement pyrealsense2>=2.2
```
This is because Intel has not written pyrealsense packages for Python that will
run on the hardware architecture commonly found in Macs. This is very annoying,
and really sucks for making the environment install process a smooth one.
(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

However, building the RealSense library from source and placing the `.so` files
into the `env/` folder manually will work for running programs that need the
RealSense library. This section will detail the process for this manual
work-around.

## How to Fix

TODO Make cleaner.

Follow GitHub issue below, but need to use
```bash
cmake .. -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=false -DBUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS=true
```
or else compile errors will ensue. Connor needed to comment out sections in
`CMakeLists.txt` file because the `-DBUILD_EXAMPLES=false` wasn't working...?

Once compile is successful and complete, DO NOT DO `sudo make install`.
The `.so` files will be in the `librealsense/build/` folder, and these need to
be moved to `env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/` in the maav-cv repo folder.
